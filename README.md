# Adventurer-COMP3000-Project
Adventurer is a 3D first-person RPG with a focus on character progression. This is the project I will be working on for COMP3000. Paul Watson is serving as my Project Supervisor.

Proposed MoSCoW Analysis (this could change futher down the line):

Must haves:
- A character creation system that allows players to create a custom character by choosing various options from the genders, races and classes that the system will offer to the player.
- A set of primary attributes that determines a character's skills and secondary attributes (i.e Personality/Charisma would affect Speech/Speechcraft, Strength affects inventory weight limit, melee damage, etc).
- A system that requires players to level up their major skills a set number of times before increasing the player's character level.
- A Finite State Machine that can act as a game manager that can be used to contain player inventory, player stats, current quests (see the corresponding entry in the Could haves section)

Should haves:
- An inventory system akin to that of Fallout and Skyrim, where each item is displayed in a list, with each item belonging to a different category (i.e. weapon, armor, consumable, miscellaneous) and having a different weight. The player can only carry so many items up to a particular weight limit, with the player's movement being impeded if the player exceeds that limit
- A dialogue system that can read data from dialogue trees to get NPC dialogue lines as well as the corresponding responses that characters could have for said lines. This system has already been created and already possesses a form of scalability in that I could expand it to include dialogue-based skill checks (i.e. characters with a high speech level could easily convince an enemy warrior to stand down and not trouble them any further, or characters with a high intelligence score could possess the option to bring something new to the table when talking with a scientist about a project that they are working on).

Could haves:
- A quest system that allows players to unlock quests by initiating dialogue with NPCs, with different quests of varying resolutions depending on how the player approaches these quests. I do not want to be too ambitious with this particular system due to 1) The nature of the project itself; 2) The focus on character progression for this project; and 3) The fact that I have never actually attempted a quest system before. 
- A simple hack-and-slash combat system that allows players to use weapons to deal damage to enemies and armour to lessen damage taken from enemy attacks. I am putting this as a "could have" because I have never touched first-person based melee combat systems before.

Won't haves (stuff that I plan on not touching, but could easily touch further down the line if I have additional time after my deliverables for the project are sorted): 
- Any crafting systems. This project is large enough in scope already without adding any systems to make weapons, armour, potions or other in-game items that could benefit the player in any way.
